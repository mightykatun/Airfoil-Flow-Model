# Airfoil-Flow-Model
Computes aerodynamical coefficients related to the flow around an airfoil.

Computes Cp (Coefficient of pressure), Cl (lift), and Cd (drag) plus adds a visual representation of velocity streamlines.

Based on: https://github.com/jte0419/Panel_Methods, adding amongst other things an imbedded NACA geometry generator and updated xfoil running script.
